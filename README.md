# YelpCamp-Project
Final Project in Colt Steele;s The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. The goal was to create a full stack web app using javascript for the front-end and back-end. Yelp Camp allows users to visit locations of campgrounds and add them to the site all of which are stored on a cloud database mongoAtlas. Once an account is made users are able to write reviews on campgrounds and create and delete their own.
